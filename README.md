Sorting Coparator by darkonion

Simple java project showing and comparing performance of different sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Default Sort (java.util.Arrays.sort())

Program is automatically creating array of given size, in range of integers of - 50000 to 50000. 

Type rather high size of array, lets say above 1000, preferably (30000 - 60000) to observe significant differences in performance.

ATTENTION: Keep in mind that program does not contain user input validation algorithm, and it is case-sensitive. This feature will be implemented soon.
