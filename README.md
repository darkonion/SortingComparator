# CommandLine Sorting Comparator

Simple java project showing and comparing performance of different sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort n^2
- Insertion Sort n^2
- Quick Sort n(logn)
- Bucket Sort n
- Default Sort (java.util.Arrays.sort())
- Default Parallel Sort
- Merge Sort n(logn)
- Shell Sort ~<n^2
- Selection Sort n^2

Program is automatically creating array of given size, in range of integers of - 50000 to 50000. 

Type rather high size of array, lets say above 1000, preferably (30000 - 60000) to observe significant differences in performance.
